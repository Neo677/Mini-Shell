Here some idea we can improve in my parsing :
		Create a handle error system wo track every foncion how use it like
               the handle operator or the pipe handler
          if an error is detected we can print message of every case 
          and of course the message will be the man return error of course 
          we can add emojis or bullshit like that

okayy so i now fix the issue with the pipe spend a day on it
also i add the detection of the environement variable so now if you try to print a varibale it now regnosize the word behind i stock in TOKEN_WORD ($VAR == '$' 'VAR')

so now i need to fix another issue with pipe if you do 
ex = 'ls |' it say you have a syntax error and leave the program for now im not sure if i have to quit or not
in bash when you have synntax error it not quit so i just follow the same logic

bug encounter or need do be fix like norm error/message
     1) display space instaed of error when there is a space or tab
               NEED TO FIXXXXX
     2) fix there is a double message when the token take a redirections wihout file
               FIXXXXX (Well done soldier ü™ñ)
     3) multiple message with many pipe
               FIXXXXX (Well done soldier ü™ñ)
     4) cat Makefile | grep pr | head -n 5 | cd file_not_exist (if the file do not exist, this is the exec part to check this with 'execve')
          issue with some hard input
               FIXXXXX (Well done soldier ü™ñ)

06/01/2025 :
For now i finish the token part and handle the syntax 
in mostly every situations
Now i need to add in a struct command if there is a pipe
So for now i re think the split fonction for my token
               FIXXXXX (Well done soldier ü™ñ)


I need to check for the variable environnements
1) the syntax
2) the name how can accept it
3) Maybe number are allowed and i only accept MAJ
               FIXXXXXX (Well done soldier ü™ñ)

	(the version of the code can act different on the 42 pc and my mac)
	Weird caractere is add to the end of each token ???

13/01/2025 :
 add header (norm)
 handle auxiliaire fonctions (split etc ...)

need to fix :
     $> cat ''hello world''
     Type: TOKEN_WORD, Value: 'cat'
     Type: TOKEN_WORD, Value: ''
     Type: TOKEN_WORD, Value: 'hello'
     Type: TOKEN_WORD, Value: 'world'''

Need to finish the signal too :
     CTRL-D work fine (i mean it was easy its only 3 ligne on the main)
        ‚ÜòÔ∏è 
          FIXXXXXX (Well done soldier ü™ñ)
     CTRL-C 
        ‚ÜòÔ∏è
         not work yet (need to do this with the sig.Mask)
     ctrl-\
        ‚ÜòÔ∏è 
          not work yet

echo "hello world" > file.txt | cat file.txt
